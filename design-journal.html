        <h2>Week One</h2>
        <p>Prompt: What do you hope to achieve in this class by the end of the term? Are there special projects or technologies you’d like to see covered by the end of the term? Is there a site (or two) that gives you butterflies in your stomach? What is it?</p>
        <p>Response: I did some coding in classes and in an internship in high school, but I've never really grasped it completely. Coding kind of scares me because I’ve always felt that I can never quite wrap my head around it, but I’m hoping that maybe this class can soften that fear. My goal is just to become at least semi-comfortable with using HTML and CSS (and just coding in general), while making some work I’m proud of.</p>
        <p>Inspiring site of the week: <a href="https://www.cameronsworld.net/">www.cameronsworld.com</a><br>This website is essentially a big collage made with graphics taken from the early web. Even though it's considered bad design practice now, I really came to appreciate the aesthetics of the old web during a project based on it that I did Spring quarter.</p>

        <h2>Week Two</h2>
        <p>Prompt: What are you planning to do for project 1? What content do you plan to show? How will you make each page unique while maintaining a cohesive design across the project? How will your color palette, imagery, and typography choice complement your subject matter?</p>
        <p>Response: I’m doing Project 1 on the different outfits of Link from The Legend of Zelda series. While he looks different in almost every game, there are major trends in his costumes, creating 5 categories. These categories will be visualized on the home page, where Link will be featured in a paper-doll inspired dress-up game. Drag and drop one of the 5 outfits, and Link’s appearance will change and information about that outfit will be displayed, rinse and repeat for all 5. <s>I also plan on having a vertical timeline on a separate page, showing each Zelda game in chronological order and being grouped together by the same 5 outfits.</s> I’m going to be illustrating all of my Link paper-doll assets myself, based on vintage illustrations which will help establish the visual style. I want to contrast this with a more modern typographic treatment, that resembles a video game menu/UI. I’m worried about how feasible the drag-and-drop function will be at this point, but I’m excited about my concept!</p>
        <p>Inspiring site of the week: <a href="https://tonyschocolonely.com/us/en">tonyschocolonely.com</a><br>I love this website, it's like a big interactive piece of art! The bright colors are kind of jarring, but they're fun. The visual style is also really cohesive.</p>

        <h2>Week Three</h2>
        <p>Prompt: Imagine one user who'll love to use your Project 1 website. This user could be you, it could be someone similar to you, it could be someone completely opposite from you, it could even be a non-human animal or an alien or an amoeba. You get to choose. Really imagine what they are like in their mind. What do they spend their time on? What are their hobbies, clothes, music, favorite foods, books, TV shows? What is their personality like? Once you've imagined this person, write about them.</p>
        <p>Response: I picture the end-user of my site to be somewhat like me. I’ve always been pretty obsessed with The Legend of Zelda (obviously, hence my project), and it’s a big video game title with a large fanbase to go along with it. This person would not only be a fan of Zelda but, like me, are somewhat fixated on the aesthetic of different entries in the franchise. Perhaps this is someone who’s even more of an obsessive fan than I am; exclusively wearing a green belted tunic and pointy cap that they really ought to wash because they refuse to take it off.</p>
        <p>Inspiring site of the week: <a href="http://davidrudnick.org/">davidrudnick.org</a><br>I really love this graphic design portfolio site I came across. The work here is really beautiful in and of itself, and the site really helps elevate it. I love the interactions that you get when you mouse over the icons and his work, it makes the site really satisfying to use.</p>

        <h2>Week Four</h2>
        <p>Prompt: Make a list of 5 things to keep you going when you feel resistance or discomfort.</p>
        <p>Response: <ul>
          <li>Allowing yourself to feel discomfort</li>
          <li>Accepting discomfort as a completely normal part of the process when learning something new</li>
          <li>Setting realistic goals and expectations, but also taking risks when you can</li>
          <li>Allowing yourself to take a break to absorb new information when you're overhwhelmed, but not allowing yourself to procrastinate or give up</li>
          <li>Picturing the end product, or what you could learn from your discomfort</li>
        </ul></p>
        <p>Inspiring site of the week: <a href="http://forge.cestainsi.online/">FORGE</a><br>This is a website for a type foundry. I love the maximalist aeshtetic of it, it's so over the top. There's even sound effects and voice overs every time you mouse ofter one of the type specimens. It's also kind of confusing, and I didn't even know what it was for at first. That could be a negative, but I found the impracticality of it really interesting, and I still felt encouraged to click around and find out what the site even was.</p>
